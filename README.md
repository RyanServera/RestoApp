For our team members:

- Always pull before coding on your local repository
- Create a separate branch and code in that branch only
- When finishing a feature, add the changes to your branch
- Push the changes to the github repo (not on the master branch)
- Do a pull request and add Allison or Bill as reviewer
- We will accept the merge if we think your code is fine

*If not sure how to do a pull request, follow this link:

https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/

*Any questions, ask on slack
